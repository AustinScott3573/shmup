A shooter game based on Phaser framework

## CONCEPT

__RPG 1942 inspired top-down Shooter__

## FEATURES

* procedural background terrain
* Endless enemies to fight
* Stat boosting!

## TODO'S

* Visually impressive bullet patterns (multiple streams, lateral pods, auto-aiming streams, homing missiles)
* better flying enemy spawn patterns
* proportional upgrades

##Â KNOWN BUGS

* More visually rich assets to make things "pop".
* endless scroll/seemless looping. "It's a feature, not a bug"
* terrain smoothing : fairly biased (especially on x axis)
